# WaniKaniDownloader
Simple command line utility for downloading data from the WaniKani API and outputting it to a text file for usage such as importing into Anki. Initially intended to download all available sentences from each vocabulary item, but eventually will be expanded to give the option to customize the download and get whatever information you need.

### API Key
WaniKani is a subscription service. By using this application, it is assumed that you have a current subscription, and you will need to provide your own API key in order for this application to be able to access the API.
